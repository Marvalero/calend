# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# Appointment.create([{ type: 'Great White', comment: 'Scary' }, { type: 'Megalodon', comment: 'Ancient' }, { type: 'Hammerhead', comment: 'Hammer-like' }, { type: 'Speartooth', comment: 'Endangered' }])
